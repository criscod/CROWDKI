# CROWDKI: Crowd-powered Knowledge Integration on the Web of Data

Despite the growth of the number of LOD datasets and the increasing variety of covered topical domains, most of the links connecting RDF resources of different datasets are identity links (often between descriptions that match perfectly) and a high number of datasets still do not contain out-links. The creation of different types of links and the process of analyzing the Linked Data space for new interlinking possibilities is time-consuming and tedious. This paper describes a crowd-powered approach to knowledge integration, which aims at supporting data publishers in designing new interlinking processes, as well as validating and enhancing automatically computed links.
