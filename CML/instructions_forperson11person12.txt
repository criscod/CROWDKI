<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
  
In this job, you will identify if the two descriptions of persons that we provide are referring to actually the same person.  You need to compare all the information provided: name, surname, age, date of birth, id, phone and address postcode, and decide whether the two descriptions are talking about the same person or not. 

<b> Important: </b>
Sometimes, descriptions might be incomplete (e.g. one description is missing the age). Some other times, the data in the description might seem incoherent (e.g. you could find a case in which the age of 02 is being compared to the age of 20, simply because the description originally contained some typos). This is normal, first, because the descriptions may come from different sources, and second, because the data by nature needs a manual quality check. That is why we need you. If you look at all the pieces of information of the descriptions you should be able to reach the decision on whether the two descriptions refer to the same person or not. 

With your answers, you make us understand how this kind of information should be compared and connected. The information that will be gathered here (i.e. your answers) will be used to enhance the methods we use for integrating information coming from different open sources. These methods become very useful when for instance, someone is creating an app that shows Web users similar information that has been written differently on the Web!

All the data that you will see and review has been openly released by an initiative, which encourages computer scientists to create methods to connect information . We are not leaking any personal information.

<h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>

<!-- BEGIN CUSTOMIZABLE PROCESS SECTION -->

Follow these easy steps:   
<ol>
  <li> Read the two descriptions that we provide  </li>
<ul>  
<li> If you think they <b> DO  refer to the same person</b>  then go to the first question of the form and select the option that says <u> yes </u>. </li>
  <li> If you think they <b> DO NOT refer to the same person</b>  then go to the first question of the form and select the option that says  <u> no </u>. </li>
</ul>
  <li> Answer the second question, by selecting the description you are asked on.  It can be either the description of the first person (labeled for example as 'person1-Person4340') or the description of the second person (labeled for example as 'person2-Person6543')</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Rules and Tips</strong></h3>
<!-- BEGIN CUSTOMIZABLE RULES AND TIPS SECTION -->
<!-- BEGIN DO THIS SECTION -->
<h4 style="color:#8cc63e;"><strong>Do This</strong></h4>

Read and compare all pieces of information of both descriptions.

<br>
<!-- END DO THIS SECTION -->

<!-- BEGIN BE CAREFUL SECTION -->
<h4 style="color:#ffcb02;"><strong>Be Careful Of</strong></h4>

Be careful and do not focus only on the first piece information that you read (e.g. name) because there might be different persons who share the same name and even surname! And you could also find two descriptions of the same person where the name and surname have been written slightly different (e.g. some people change their surnames when they get married). 

<br>

<!--END BE CAREFUL SECTION -->

<!-- BEGIN DO NOT SECTION -->
<h4 style="color:#f05921;"><strong>Do Not</strong></h4>

Please do not look for equal values in all the pieces information (i.e. in all features from name to postal code) and decide that the descriptions talk about the same person only when all values match. The goal of the task is not to find perfect matches, but instead, to be able to identify descriptions that even if they do not match perfectly, you can deduce from the whole overview that they are about the same person.
